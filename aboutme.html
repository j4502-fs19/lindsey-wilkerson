    <h2> Get to know me </h2>
    <p>Lindsey Wilkerson is a native of southwest Missouri. She grew up in Rogersville, just east of Springfield, and graduated from Logan-Rogersville High School in 2015. She knew she wanted to be a journalist since she was in middle school, so she applied to Mizzou’s prestigious journalism school.</p>
    <p>Now, she is graduating with a Bachelors of Journalism, emphasizing in Radio/TV Anchoring and Reporting, with a minor in political science. She has earned a multicultural certificate, as well as a general honors certificate from the Honors College.</p>
    <p>She is graduating with honors and has ranked in the top 10 percent of the December 2019 graduating class. She was also invited to join the journalism honor society, Kappa Tau Alpha.</p>
    <p>Lindsey is also currently a second-year law student at Mizzou Law. She is enrolled in the MU Law Scholars program, an accelerated joint degree program which will allow her complete both her Bachelors of Journalism and Juris Doctorate in six years.</p>
    <p>As part of her broadcast studies, she began working at KOMU 8 News, the mid-Missouri NBC affiliate, starting in 2016. As a student reporter, she covered a variety topics ranging from investigative stories to breaking news. Her experience at KOMU provided her the opportunity to interview Sen. Roy Blunt, Gov. Mike Parson and First Lady Teresa Parson, as well as many other leaders in mid-Missouri.</p>
    <p>After graduating from the Missouri School of Journalism, Lindsey will continue law school at Mizzou Law for another year and a half before graduating with her J.D. She plans to use both degrees together to become either a legal analyst or an attorney specializing in protecting journalists’ First Amendment rights.</p>
