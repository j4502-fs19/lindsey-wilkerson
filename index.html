  <h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
  <h3>I'm a journalist, but I'm also studying to be a lawyer... I picked the two most co professions by the public, but I couldn't be happier!
  <h3>I took this career path because have a passion for people. In both the legal and journalism fields, we communicate and represent others by telling their stories. We give a voice to the underdog and investigate wrongdoing and corruption.</h3>
  <h3>Being a journalist has always been my dream job, but I also think it's so important to be educated about politics, government, and the law. I decided to go to law school so that I would be better prepared to tell the public about important issues and events.</h3>
  <h3>In December 2019, I will graduate with my Bachelors in Journalism, with an emphasis in Radio/TV Anchoring and Reporting. Meanwhile, I'll be halfway through law school! I'll graduate from law school in May 2021.</h3>
